# About This Mod

When's the last time you traveled by minecart, horse, or boat after having acquired an elytra? Probably never.

Most of Minecraft's transportation methods become obsolete the moment you get an elytra, and this mod reworks some of them in an attempt to remedy the problem while trying to keep the Vanilla feel. Importantly, it can be used on servers *without* requiring players to also install it on their end!

Below is a list of the changes this mod makes, along with some of the reasoning behind them.

## Changes to Minecarts & Rails

### 1. Changed rail & powered rail crafting recipes.

Minecarts' biggest problem is that building the necessary infrastructure is not only time-consuming, but very expensive. Gold is relatively uncommon, and crafting rails requires a lot of resources for mediocre output.

Meanwhile, copper is quite common but has very few uses outside of creative buildingâ€”to the point that many players don't even bother mining it when they see it. By replacing gold with copper in the powered rail recipe and increasing the crafting yield for both rails and powered rails, this mod aims to reduce how resource-intensive it is to set up a rail network.
   
### 2. TODO - Increase minecart speed.

Minecarts max out at 8m/s, which is barely faster than a player can sprint-jump (7.12m/s). Minecarts were added to the game before sprinting was, so at the time they moved nearly twice as fast as a player could, and they just haven't been buffed since.

Unfortunately, simply increasing the max speed leads to frequent derailment and minecarts getting stuck in odd places, so fixing this will require a more in-depth approach.

## Changes to (Ice)Boats

### 1. Boats no longer move at insane speeds on ice.

Boats belong in the water. Now their max speed is drastically reduced when they aren't in the water.

### 2. Ice and packed ice now melts in the nether.

The nether is hot, why doesn't ice melt there? Now it does, along with packed ice. Blue ice remains exempt, as ice + pistons are useful for moving items around in a place with no water.

## Changes to Elytra

### TODO - Nerf it.

It's too strong. There's no way around it. "But it's an end-game method of transportation, so it's fine!" Is it though? Killing the ender dragon and finding an end city with an elytra can be done much faster than building a 1000-block-long minecart track, and you can use it to go wherever you want, not just where you built that rail line to.

Within a few hours you can have an elytra and a fully automatic gunpowder farm, at which point it takes zero effort to get anywhere anymore. No other transportation method comes remotely close in speed or flexibility, let alone both.

It also removes any need to build infrastructure (roads, rails, canals, etc.) in your world, which can help locations feel more connected and make the world feel more alive and lived in. The 2-Week Minecraft Phase might last quite a bit longer if you had a reason to connect things instead of just flying everywhere.

The question is how does one nerf such a thing without making it entirely useless?
